we use NodeJS and SocketIO to achieve this functionality


* In http protocol server cant use post and get requests to get info from client

--> can be done using Long polling but complex
--> this can also be done with Web Socket which makes things easier for  us and makes a two way connection

Introduction
What Socket.IO is
Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.


* we can use ajax but this will not be efficient to get data from database everytime
